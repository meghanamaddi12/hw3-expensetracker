# Expense Tracker – CS520 Spring 2025 HW3

This project is an extension of the previous Homework 2 "Expense Tracker" application. It is a Java Swing-based GUI app that allows users to track daily expenses. The application uses the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture and showcases software engineering principles including **modularity**, **extensibility**, **debuggability**, and **testability**.
